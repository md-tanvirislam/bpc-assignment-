The Boost Physio Clinic Management System is a Java-based console application designed to manage the operations of a physiotherapy clinic. It enables the management of patients, physiotherapists, treatments, and appointments through a simple and user-friendly text interface.

At the core of the system is the Clinic class, which handles the addition and removal of patients, manages physiotherapists and their areas of expertise, and coordinates the booking, cancellation, and check-in of appointments. Patients and physiotherapists are modeled using the Patient and Physiotherapist classes, both of which inherit from a common Person abstract class that stores shared attributes such as ID, name, address, and phone number. Treatments offered at the clinic are represented by the Treatment class, while individual appointments are encapsulated by the Appointment class, which associates a patient, a physiotherapist, and a treatment at a specific date and time.

The system allows users to perform operations such as adding new patients, removing existing ones, booking appointments based on physiotherapist expertise or by directly selecting a physiotherapist, canceling appointments, and checking patients in when they arrive for their scheduled treatment. The application also includes functionality to generate reports listing all physiotherapists and their scheduled appointments, displaying the appointment status and patient information.

To run the program, users must have Java 8 or later installed. The Java source files should be compiled, and the application can then be started by running the Main class. Upon launch, the system presents a menu-driven interface where users can select options to interact with the clinic database.

This project offers a foundational structure for a clinic management system, with future improvements planned to include features such as a graphical user interface, persistent data storage through files or a database, and notification systems to remind patients of upcoming appointments.
